//
// Kept in its own header, rather than in pals_expand.cpp where the expander's
// problems are raised, because the name checks in pals_check.cpp report into
// the same list. Not part of the public C API declared in yaml_c_wrapper.h.

// this library's limitation, or the standard's silence, name their kind -- so a
// call site that says nothing is making the common claim, not skipping the
