 * The trees are built as a derivation chain (original -> combined ->

 * link records which node in each tree a single logical entity maps to.
 *
 * The mapping is functional per link: one full_expanded (or adjunct) node maps
 * to at most one combined node, which maps to at most one original node. Because
 * expansion can duplicate nodes (scalar substitution, `repeat`, `inherit`,
 * forks), a single combined/original node may appear in several links — one per
 * copy. A field is YAML_NULL_ID when no corresponding node exists (e.g. the
 * `destination_pointer` scalars synthesised during expansion have no original
 * source).
 *
 * Expansion splits the document, so a link carries either a `full_expanded` id
 * or a `adjunct` id, never both; the two are tied together through the
 * `combined` id they share. A definition that was substituted into the lattice
 * therefore yields links on both sides: one for the copy in `full_expanded`, one
 * for the definition still standing in `adjunct`.
 *
 * The `expanded` tree is not mapped: it is a pruned copy of `full_expanded`, so
 * a node in it is found by the path it sits at, not by a recorded link.

 * spliced inline.
 *           - `full_expanded`: the selected lattice fully expanded — scalars
 * substituted, repeats unrolled, inherits merged, and forks resolved — and
 * nothing else. Rooted at a map holding the single `name: {kind: Lattice, ...}`
 * entry, stripped of the PALS/facility scaffolding it was defined under. Its
 * `branches` entries are branches, not the BeamLines they were built from, and
 * so carry no `kind`; a BeamLine referenced inside a `line:` is a sub-line whose
 * contents are spliced directly into the enclosing line, so no nested BeamLine
 * survives. Elements of a `multipass` line carry a `multipass_index` giving
 * their pass number — how many times a particle will have travelled through
 * that physical element by that point. Every dependent parameter has been
 * computed: each element carries its `element_index` — its position, counting
 * from one, in the branch line that holds it — its `ReferenceP`, `FloorP` and
 * `s_position`,
 * the derived members of every parameter family it uses (`Kn1L` alongside
 * `Kn1`, `voltage` alongside `gradient`, ...), the non-zero defaults of the
 * groups it carries, and each branch is capped with a `branch_end` Placeholder
 * holding its final reference and floor.
 *           - `expanded`: the same lattice with all of that removed. Which
 * parameters it keeps is decided by what the author wrote: one is held when it
 * was present before bookkeeping ran or was written by a post-`expand_lattice`
 * `set`, and everything else the bookkeeper computed is pruned, along with any
 * group left empty and the `branch_end` elements. The *values* it holds are the
 * finished ones — this is `full_expanded` with nodes removed, not an earlier
 * snapshot, so a parameter present in both trees carries the same value in
 * both, with every `set` and ABSOLUTE controller applied. Use it to see what
 * was asked for rather than what it implies, or to write a lattice back out
 * without the derived values.
 *           - `adjunct`: the rest of the document, keeping its PALS/facility
 * scaffolding: element and beamline definitions, `use` statements, constants,
 * and any Lattice that was not the one expanded. Definitions substituted into
 * the lattice are copies, so they appear in both trees.

 *         saying whether the lattice author can do anything about it. The list
 *         is empty when expansion was clean. The caller owns it and must
